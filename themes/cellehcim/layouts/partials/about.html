<p>Hi! I'm Michelle and welcome to my professional internet space! I'm a passionate introverted extrovert with a <a href="https://www.bcit.ca/programs/computer-systems-technology-diploma-full-time-5500dipma/">BCIT Computer Systems Technology diploma</a> and a steaming cup of hot green tea within a metre of me. I enjoy building things with code (since high school), along with figuring out the “why” behind why something works...or doesn't.</p>

<p>I have a year of experience from working in startup-like environments, one of which was within a regional household name. During that year, I worked alongside non-technical stakeholders, more experienced developers, and other team members who raised my standards for what's expected in a deliverable (be it a web application, a support ticket, or documentation). From those environments, I've had the opportunity to create deliverables that are easy to understand and use (and mantain for code).</p>

<p>Outside of creating code and learning more about technology (...and tea), I also enjoy baking a new dessert, the good ol' keyboard-and-mouse gaming, learning a new human language (CEFR A2.1 in both French and German), and talking about aspects of Asian popular culture at events.</p>

<p>Feel free to check out my résumé, connect with me on <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/cellehcim">LinkedIn</a>, or drop a line through [firstname] at cellehcim dot com.</p>
