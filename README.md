# Cellehcim dot com!

(Built with Hugo, Bootstrap, and your good ol' HTML and CSS)

## The big idea

When I initially designed the website, I didn't want to manually add divs each time I update my experience or projects section. The best way for me to avoid this was by integrating templates (such as those powered using Hugo) into those two sections, so it automatically adds those divs for me given the corresponding lists (and attributes for each item) 

## How to run

Start a local version of this site (`localhost:1313`) using `hugo server`.
